#About me

As a determined Electrical Engineer specialized in Control & Automation, and Power, I possess circuit design and software development skills, a substantive work experience, teamwork and communication skills, and a true passion for robotics and creative work.

I particularly enjoy open-source hardware design, FPGAs, electronic layout and prototyping, and developing interactive applications for personal robots.
