I was very lucky to have been interviewed by [Nora Young for Spark](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/), a CBC podcast about new technologies. This news is a bit late though because this was for the March 25th edition of the show, but nonetheless, I think it is good to document it here.

You can listen to the full interview [here](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2012/03/spark-177-march-25-2012/). It is about MyRobots.com and the concept of a social network for robots.
