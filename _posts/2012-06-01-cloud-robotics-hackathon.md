Back in March we organized the first [Global Cloud Robotics Hackathon](http://roboticshackathon.com/). Along with Sara Ahmadian, the co-organizer and all the other collaborations here in Montreal and around the world, we brought together around 200 people in eight locations around the world. The main goal of the hackathon was to allow programmers to jump into the robotics world through the use of the new and exciting field of Cloud Robotics.

You can see all the information about the event in [its official](http://roboticshackathon.com/) website as well as the resulting presentations in the [Cloud Robotics Hackathon YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/RoboticsHackathon).

For sure, there will be more iterations of this hackathon in the future!
