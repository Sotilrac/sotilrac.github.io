I was interviewed and featured in an article about the future of robotics on the [New Scientist magazine from January 2012](http://www.newscientist.com/issue/2848). The article was written by the awesome [Celeste Biever](http://www.newscientist.com/search?rbauthors=Celeste+Biever).

Needless to say, I am truly humbled to have been quoted among so many amazing roboticists including Andrew Ng (my dear [ML Class](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) professor).
