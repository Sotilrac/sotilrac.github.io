Nao 1337 and I participated in the first edition of the [Montreal Mini Maker Faire](http://www.makerfairemontreal.ca). We were quite impressed by the organization and the attendance, it was a blast. Nao1337 could play with children at Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, hold their hands and walk with them, do some dance demonstrations, and show off.

We had the chance to meet some very interesting people, including (but certainly not limited to) [Bertier Luyt](http://batitrad.pro/) from [Le FabShop](http://www.lefabshop.fr/) and [Marc-Andr√© Bazergui](http://www.youtube.com/user/bazmarc), creator of a fully functional LEGO Wall-E.
