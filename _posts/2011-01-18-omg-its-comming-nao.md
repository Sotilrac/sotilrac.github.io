I joined [Aldebaran's developer program](http://www.robotshop.com/blog/aldebaran-developer-program-the-future-is-nao-1137) and now my Nao is coming (much faster than I expected). They even sent me a picture of the box prior to shipping it.

This is an amazing experience and you can be sure I'll be sharing all of it in here.

Stay tuned for more Nao news!
