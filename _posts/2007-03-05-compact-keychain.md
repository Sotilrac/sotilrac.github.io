**Update:** I have done an improved version: [the compact keychain 2.0](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2009/03/compact-keychain-20/ "Compact Keychain 2.0").

This is a nice keychain I've been using for more than a year now. Since it broke, I had to rebuild it so I took this chance to share it with the rest or the world.

## Materials

*   3 washers (number of keys + 1)
*   Some keys (I use only two keys)
*   A pop rivet (requires a river gun)

## Construction

1.  Fasten the keys together using the rivet and put washers between them.
2.  Admire your creation.

That's it. It works well with my two keys, and it is very compact and quiet.
