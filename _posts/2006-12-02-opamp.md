Active-loaded differential amplifier. This is the first Stage of the op amp, with a 5o dB Gain.

Class-AB output stage. This second stage alows for driving small loads and increases the overall gain a bit (~10 V/V).

*Note:* all circuit schematics account for the pin capacitance of the packaged IC (Cpad = 5 pF). Also the loading effect of the oscilloscope probe used to perform the experimental measurements is accounted for in the schematics by modeling the probe as a resistor (Rprobe = 1 MÎ©) in parallel with a capacitor (Cprobe = 15 pF).

A close up on the naked chip. Pretty neat.

I'll post more details soon.
