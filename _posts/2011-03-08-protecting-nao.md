Nao is a very expensive piece of equipment and It would be a shame if it got dirty, scratched or damaged. Nevertheless, the official Nao suitcase is prices at 777.77 USD. This is rather expensive A suitable alternative is the cheaper [Plasticase Nanuk 945](http://www.robotshop.com/ca/plasticase-nanuk-extreme-heavy-duty-case-22-inch-3.html) which is as sturdy and IMHO much better looking.

As explained in the video below, I also use clear Duck tape to protect Nao's surfaces. This tape is inexpensive, does not leave any residue and is very strong.

Also, as a follow-up of the video, in order to better protect Nao from the friction in the pelvic region, I use [D-profile self-adhesive rubber tape](http://www.amazon.com/Frost-V25WA-Extreme-Weather-Strip-8-Inch-by1/dp/B000B4N3OA) (the kind you normally use in door frames to prevent air from coming in). Since it is white and mate like Nao it goes very well and makes for a nice belt.
