The Control behaviour is one if the first behaviours I created for Nao 1337. Although it was not very popular at the app contest, I truly believe it is the only useful behaviours so far. It is very simple and its main goal is to allow the user to make Nao sit , stand, change the volume level, the language and launch programs. This set of features might have been superseded by the current Nao Life behaviours from Aldebaran but I have not tested it yet. One very important requirement for me is to be able to perform all this actions while away of a computer or any other device and with no WiFi.

As always, you can find the code and further information about the behaviour in the [project page](http://developer.aldebaran-robotics.com/projects/nao-control/) at the [Developer Program site](http://developer.aldebaran-robotics.com/projects/nao-control/).
