[RobotShop](http://www.robotshop.com/) in collaboration with [Carlitos' Contraptions](http://carlitoscontraptions.com) is creating a series of videos about DIY electronic and robotic projects.

For these projects, I'll be putting together some electronic kits along with instructional blog posts and videos at [GoRobotics.net](http://www.robotshop.com/gorobotics/ "GoRobotics.net"). The main idea is to create more complex gadgets from off-the-shelf components.

So far, I have some projects in mind such as an LED mood cube, a mini automation web-server, and a speech-controlled robot to name a few.

Stay tuned for the upcoming projects.
