In the last year, I created my first full hardware design, including its custom firmware, for RobotShop. Of course, the design is open source so you can reuse it however you like. The end-result is the [MyRobots Connect](http://www.robotshop.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pc=RB-Myr-01), a Serial-to-Ethernet gateway.

I used the amazing [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) and you can find the design files in the [MyRobots Github page](https://github.com/myrobots/MyRobots.com/tree/master/Hardware%20Design). If you want to know more about how this device works, see its [wiki page](http://www.myrobots.com/wiki/MyRobots_Connect). But in short, it translates serial messages received via XBee into HTTP GETs to [MyRobots API](http://www.myrobots.com/wiki/API).

See below some PCB pr0n.
