I named him Nao [1337](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) but I am open to suggestions. You can leave a comment below if you think of a better name. You can see a quick presentation of this awesome humanoid robot below.

I'll be posting further developments, images and pictures as I progress. I am planning on making several applications in order to achieve my ultimate goal of having Nao play chess.

### The Bandana

As you can see in the pictures and videos, Nao1337 wears a red bandana. This is manly because he is bad-ass and utterly cool.
