Ever since I discovered the wonders of FPGA boards I wanted to have one of my own (instead of using the one provided by the university only for university projects). Not long ago my wish granted.

Thanks to a very (extremely) kind professor, I got a Spartan [D2E](http://digilentinc.com/Data/Products/D2E/D2E-brochure.pdf) FPGA board complete with a [DIO1](http://digilentinc.com/Data/Products/DIO1/DIO1-brochure.pdf) board. I am thankful for my professor's generosity and I will never be able to thank him enough.

Have a look at some pictures of the board.

I shall be back soon with something implemented on it.
