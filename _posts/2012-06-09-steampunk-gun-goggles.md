I was invited to a Pride & Prejudice & Zombies themed party and I thought that (although it is not exactly the same era) I could have a steampunk disguise and be a steampunk zombie hunter.

I wanted to have a steampunk disguise for a long time and this was the perfect excuse to do it, or actually to have my brother, Alan, do it for me. While I worried about the clothes, he built an awesome steampunk gun based on a cheap Nerf knock-off and some goggles using plumbing parts. See the awesome results below.
