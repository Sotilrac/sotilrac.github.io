The video is only available for Canada.

Nao 1337 stayed next to Denis Talbot, the host, the entire time while doing some pretty random actions. This was not planned at all and it lead to many funny moments. My interview at the end of the episode was pretty much improvised also, but I think everything went pretty well overall.

Here are some corrections regarding what was said during the show:

*   Nao is 59 cm tall and not 53 cm (sorry, that was my mistake).
*   Nao is sold as a fully assembled platform and not a kit.
*   I am a mere Nao developer, I am not its creator by any stretch of the imagination.
