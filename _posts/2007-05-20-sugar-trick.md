I read that one can erase the branding on products by using a sugar cube and a bit of saliva (I'm guessing the saliva part). This came handy when I got a free 128MB USB key in a DVD-R pack.

This is the key in it's original state.

By rubbing a cube of sugar (lubricated with some handy saliva), I easily removed the branding without scratching the plastic.

After a bit of cleaning I go a nice USB key without any branding and no traces of saliva.
