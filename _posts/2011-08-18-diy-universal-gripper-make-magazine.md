I am very happy to announce that my [DIY universal gripper project](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2010/10/diy-universal-robot-gripper/) has been featured in Make magazine Volume 27. See the article below. Also check out [my updated version of the gripper.](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2011/05/diy-universal-jamming-gripper-2-0/)

I am very happy about this, the only issue is that for some reason, they think my name is Carlos Asmat Jr., but there is no such thing as "Jr." in my name.
