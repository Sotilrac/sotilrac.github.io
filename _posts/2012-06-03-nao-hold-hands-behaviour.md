[![Nao Holds my Hand](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0760-300x224.jpg "Nao Holds my Hand")](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0760.jpg)

If you remember, for last year's [Robot Film Festival](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/tag/robot-film-festival/), Nao 1337 walked the red carpet by holding my hand. I took some time in order to better document the behaviour, improve it a bit and make a video description of it that you can see below.

Of course, you can find the code and the [project page](http://developer.aldebaran-robotics.com/projects/hold-hands/) at the [Developer Program Site](http://developer.aldebaran-robotics.com/projects/hold-hands/).
