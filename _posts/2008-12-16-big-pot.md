I found a big potentiometer in [McGill](http://www.mcgill.ca/)'s garbage (universities' garbage is pretty good). When I found it, it was very dirty and its body was badly bent. Fortunately, I managed to put it back together and now it is shiny and fully functional (as shiny and functional as a pot can be).

## Some Specs:

It is a 400 Ohms potentiometer made out of an array of thin metal hexagons and a contact point that moves along them. The number of hexagons in between one end of the array and the moving contact is proportional to the potentiometer's resistance. It is roughly 50 cm long and I bet it can handle lots of current.
