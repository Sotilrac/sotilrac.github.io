Awesome news! The Montreal Gazette recently published a nice article about the international cooperation project I participated some time ago: [The Ecuadorian Makecation](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2010/02/ecuadorian-makecation/ "Trip to Ecuador").

You can find the article here: [Students' trip to Ecuador is no vacation](http://www.montrealgazette.com/technology/Students+trip+Ecuador+vacation/2599612/story.html).
