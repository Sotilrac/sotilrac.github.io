Nao 1337 and I participated in the September 14th [M. Net TV show](http://www.musiqueplus.com/emissions/m-net-1.950689) on [Musique Plus](http://www.musiqueplus.com/). We were invited to present Nao to the public and explain a bit about the developers program.

If you were not able to catch the show on Friday at 19:30 or on Tuesday at 11:00, despair not. Once it is available in roughly three weeks, I'll be posting a link and perhaps embedding the show in this page (if [M. Net](https://twitter.com/MNetMP) and [Musique Plus](https://twitter.com/MusiquePlus) do not object).

**Update**: See [the full episode here](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2012/10/nao-at-m-net-finaly-online/).

For the moment, you can see a short clip from the show below.

During the entire one-hour show, 1337 sat besides the show host [Denis Talbot](http://www.denis-talbot.com/) and acted completely autonomously. Without any sense of timing, he talked, sang, moved, laughed, and did much more throughout the entire show, interrupting and defying everyone. He effectively became the most annoying robotic guest on a TV show.
