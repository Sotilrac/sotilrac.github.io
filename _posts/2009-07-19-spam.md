Lately the site has been experiencing some server errors (aka 500 errors). although my host seems to think it is because I use too much memory and I should buy a better hosting plan, I am sure it is caused by spam.

My post on the [Xbox Media Center](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2007/07/fully-featured-media-center-on-a-budget/) has been getting thousands of hits of "people" trying to posts comments. In order to stop this, I disabled the comment feature in this article and I changed its address. Ever since this, the site has been doing fine without any errors.

And now, for something completely different:
