## What is Carlitos' Contraptions doing at the Geekfest?

I am a geek, it is no secret, and I love geeky stuff so the Geekfest is a very good place to be for me. Beyond that, I would like to share with the Montreal community my latest developments with the Nao, some of my previous contraptions and promote my upcoming gadgets design service.
