A few weeks ago, I received a very pleasant message: [Altium](http://altium.com/ "Altium"), an FPGA development board manufacturer and IDE developer, contacted me asking If I wanted to try the (excessively cool) brand new development board (the [NanoBoard 3000](http://nb3000.altium.com/intro.html "NanoBoard 3000")) for free. Of course, I immediately (and quite emphatically) said _YES_.

Now that I got it, I'm dying to have some spear time in order to try out their awesome board with their quite intriguing IDE.

## About the Hardware

The NanoBoard 3000 is a beautiful piece of equipment. It boasts lots of cool peripherals and is built and packed as a luxury electronics product. It is a very good looking piece of equipment while remaining perfectly functional, it beats by far all the other development boards I am familiar with (i.e. the Altera DE2 board and the Lattice Mico32 development board) while remaining much cheaper (around 50% of their price).

## Features

Here is a selection of the [NanoBoard's features](http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/NanoBoard+3000+Series "NanoBoard 3000 Wiki Page") from [Altium's Wiki](http://wiki.altium.com "Altium's Wiki") I find most prominent:

*   A Xilinx Spartan-3AN device (XC3S1400AN-4FGG676C)

I should post some further details and perhaps even a simple test project soon (as soon as I get [Altium Designer](http://www.altium.com/altiumsite/products/altium-designer/en/altium-designer_home.cfm "Altium Designer") and Xilinx ISE installed and running)
