As the first [Carlitos' Project](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/tag/carlitos-project/), I put together a 4x4x4 RGB LED Mood Cube. This cube is composed of 64 RGB LEDs that can generate any colour you can imagine.

The main idea is to display colourful patterns and nice animations in this 3D LED matrix. In order to do so, the LEDs are controlled by a [Rainbowduino](http://www.robotshop.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pc=RB-See-76), the lovechild of an [Arduino](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/project/arduino/) and an LED driver. The Rainbowduino can power up to 192 LEDs which is exactly the number required for this project (4x4x4x3 = 192).

See the instructional video below if you want to put together a cube of your own. Be prepared to watch me do a lot of soldering at 10x speed.
