I started learning [ROS](http://www.ros.org/wiki/About%20ros.org) (the Robot Operating System) some time ago and I have to say it is an awesome system. It makes it very easy to reuse code for robotic projects and to benefit from tons of work done in robotics so far.

When I saw that Willow Garage (and now the OSRF) organized [ROSCon](http://roscon.ros.org/), a ROS developer conference, I couldn't help but assist. Needless to say, it was a blast, I had the chance to learn a lot, and got a bunch of robotic swag.

See the slideshow below for some pictures of the talks , robots and Saint Paul (MN), the city where it took place.
